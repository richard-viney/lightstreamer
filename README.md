Easily interface with a Lightstreamer service from Ruby. Written against the
[official API specification](http://www.lightstreamer.com/docs/client_generic_base/Network%20Protocol%20Tutorial.pdf).

## License

Licensed under the MIT license. You must read and agree to its terms to use this software.

## Installation

Install the latest version of the `lightstreamer` gem with the following command:

```
$ gem install lightstreamer
```

## Usage — Library

The two primary classes that make up the public API are:

- [`Lightstreamer::Session`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rviney/lightstreamer/Lightstreamer/Session)
- [`Lightstreamer::Subscription`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rviney/lightstreamer/Lightstreamer/Subscription)

The following code snippet demonstrates how to setup a Lightstreamer session, a subscription, then print streaming
output as it comes in.

```ruby
require 'lightstreamer'

# Create a new session that connects to the Lightstreamer demo server, which needs no authentication
session = Lightstreamer::Session.new server_url: 'http://push.lightstreamer.com',
                                     adapter_set: 'DEMO', username: '', password: ''

# Connect the session
session.connect

# Create a new subscription that subscribes to thirty items and to four fields on each item
subscription = session.build_subscription items: (1..30).map { |i| "item#{i}" },
                                          fields: [:ask, :bid, :stock_name, :time],
                                          mode: :merge, adapter: 'QUOTE_ADAPTER'

# Create a thread-safe queue
queue = Queue.new

# When new data becomes available for the subscription it will be put on the queue. This callback
# will be run on a worker thread.
subscription.on_data do |subscription, item_name, item_data, new_values|
  queue.push item_data
end

# Start streaming data for the subscription
subscription.start

# Loop printing out new data as soon as it becomes available on the queue
loop do
  data = queue.pop
  puts "#{data[:time]} - #{data[:stock_name]} - bid: #{data[:bid]}, ask: #{data[:ask]}"
end
```

## Usage — Command-Line Client

This gem provides a simple command-line client that can connect to a Lightstreamer server, activate a
subscription, then print streaming output from the server as it becomes available.

To print streaming data from the demo server run the following command:

```
lightstreamer --server-url http://push.lightstreamer.com --adapter-set DEMO --adapter QUOTE_ADAPTER \
              --items item1 item2 item3 item4 item5 --fields ask bid stock_name time
```

To see a full list of available options for the command-line client run the following command:

```
lightstreamer help stream
```
