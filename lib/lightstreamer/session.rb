module Lightstreamer
  # This class is responsible for managing a Lightstreamer session, and along with the {Subscription} class forms the
  # primary API for working with Lightstreamer. Start by calling {#initialize} with the desired server URL and other
  # options, then call {#connect} to initiate the session. Once connected create subscriptions using
  # {#build_subscription} and then start streaming data by calling {Subscription#start} or {#start_subscriptions}.
  # See the {Subscription} class for details on how to consume the streaming data as it arrives.
