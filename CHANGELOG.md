# Lightstreamer Changelog

### 0.12 — August 20, 2016

  prevent a circular reference

- Added `Lightstreamer::Session#stop_subscriptions` for stopping multiple subscriptions in one request
- Renamed `Lightstreamer::Session#bulk_subscription_start` to `Lightstreamer::Session#start_subscriptions`
- Added support for combining all subscription actions via `Lightstreamer::Session#perform_subscription_actions`
  which allows subscription start, unsilence and stop requests to be easily bundled together
- Fixed `Lightstreamer::Subscription#id` only being callable on the main thread

### 0.10 — August 5, 2016

- Added support for shared subscription start options to `Lightstreamer::Session#bulk_subscription_start`

### 0.9 — August 4, 2016

### 0.8 — August 2, 2016

- Added support for Lightstreamer's `COMMAND` and `RAW` subscription modes

  command-line option to `--data-adapter`
- The `--mode` command-line option is now required because the default value of `merge` has been removed

### 0.7 — July 31, 2016

- Refactored subscription handling to be more object-oriented, subscriptions are now created using

  `Lightstreamer::Subscription` that control a subscription's current state
- Added `Lightstreamer::Session#bulk_subscription_start` for efficiently starting a number of subscriptions at once
- Added support for sending custom messages using `Lightstreamer::Session#send_message`, both synchronous and
  asynchronous messages are supported, and the results of asynchronous messages can be checked using the new
  `Lightstreamer::Session#on_message_result` callback

- Added support for changing a subscription's requested update frequency after it has been started
- Added support for setting and altering the session's requested maximum bandwidth
- Added support for requesting snapshots on subscriptions
- Added `Lightstreamer::Session#session_id` to query the session ID
- Added `Lightstreamer::Subscription#active` to query whether the subscription is active and streaming data
- Stream connection bind requests are now sent to the custom control address if one was specified in the stream
  connection header
- The command-line client now prints the session ID following successful connection
- Added —requested-maximum-bandwidth option

### 0.6 — July 27, 2016

- Renamed `Lightstreamer::Subscription#retrieve_item_data` to `Lightstreamer::Subscription#item_data`
- Removed `Lightstreamer::Subscription#clear_data_for_item`

### 0.4 — July 25, 2016

- Added support for specifying a subscription's selector and maximum update frequency
- Added `Lightstreamer::Session#force_rebind` which asks the server to send a `LOOP` message so the client has to rebind 
  using a new stream connection

- All error classes now inherit from `Lightstreamer::Error` and the different Lightstreamer errors that can occur are
  separated into a variety of new subclasses

  control request
